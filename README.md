# Overview

- this is still a WIP, and we'll be adding recipes daily
- all of the tests are found in [`cypress/integration`](./cypress/integration)
- we boot a separate node server per recipe
- each [`example`](./examples) has all of its own backend and frontend assets

# Installation

```bash
## install all dependencies
npm install

## boot the various node servers
## to use in the tests
npm start

## or if you want to make modifications
## to the node server code and have
## the servers automatically restart
npm run dev
```
