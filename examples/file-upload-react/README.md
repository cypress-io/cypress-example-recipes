# file-upload-react

Tests React component that uploads a file. React source is in [index.html](index.html), tests in [cypress/integration/spec.js](cypress/integration/spec.js)

Key concepts

- Passing synthetic test file to upload via an [`.trigger('change')`](https://on.cypress.io/trigger) event
- Stub remote server using [`cy.route()`](https://on.cypress.io/route)
- Alternatively stub `axios.post` method using [`cy.stub()`](https://on.cypress.io/stub)

Alternatively use [`cypress-file-upload`](https://github.com/abramenal/cypress-file-upload) for file upload testing.
