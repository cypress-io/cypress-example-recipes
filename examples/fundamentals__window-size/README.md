# Browser window size vs Application viewport

![Showing the window dimensions](images/page.png)

The browser window, the command log, and the application's iframe sizes are printed.

The [setupNodeEvents](cypress.config.js) function increases the browser window size when running in the headless mode to produce high quality video. See [launch api](https://on.cypress.io/browser-launch-api) for more documentation.

**Note:** increasing the browser window size seems to not work very well in Electron browser
