# logging-in__jwt
> Example of logging in using JWT

- Test login UI form
- Use [`cy.request()`](https://on.cypress.io/request) once to get user object and JWT
- Before each test set the JWT and the user object in `localStorage` before visiting the page
- The opened page instantly has the user logged in

The front-end SPA logs in and stores the JWT and user information in the `localStorage` item named `user`

All Ajax requests to the protected resources need to have `Authorization` header with the `Bearer <token>` value.

## Tests

- [cypress/e2e/using-ui-spec.cy.js](cypress/e2e/using-ui-spec.cy.js) tests the login user interface form
- [cypress/e2e/spec.cy.js](cypress/e2e/spec.cy.js) shows how to log in once using [cy.request](https://on.cypress.io/request) and then set the JWT in the `localStorage` to log in instantly before each test
