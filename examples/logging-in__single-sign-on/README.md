# logging-in-single-sign-on
> Login when authentication is done on a 3rd party server.

The app server [app_server.js](app_server.js) runs on port 7074 and the auth server [auth_server.js](auth_server.js) runs on port 7075. File [cypress/integeation/logging-in-single-sign-on-spec.js](cypress/integeation/logging-in-single-sign-on-spec.js) describes the overall authentication flow and implements tests that follow it.

The tests show how to:

- Automatically parse tokens using [`cy.request()`](https://on.cypress.io/request) and set as cookies
- Manually set tokens on local storage (similar to SPA flow).
- Map external hosts like `auth.corp.com:7075` and point to local servers `127.0.0.1:7075` in [cypress.json](cypress.json)
- Get authentication token once and set it before each test for speed

**tip** to start the server and run Cypress GUI use script `npm run dev`
