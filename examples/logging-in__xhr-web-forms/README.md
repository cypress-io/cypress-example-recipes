> Log into the server using XHR from end-to-end tests

See the login XHR code in [login.hbs](login.hbs)

See tests in [cypress/integration/logging-in-xhr-web-form-spec.js](cypress/integration/logging-in-xhr-web-form-spec.js) that show how to log in using UI or [`cy.request`](https://on.cypress.io/request)

**tip** to start the server and run Cypress GUI use script `npm run dev`

Highly recommended: watch video ["Organizing Tests, Logging In, Controlling State"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XQOK0v_YRE)
