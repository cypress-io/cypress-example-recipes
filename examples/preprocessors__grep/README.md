# Selecting tests using Mocha-like "grep"

- Use Mocha-like syntax to select tests to run
- Implemented as a preprocessor [cypress-select-tests](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-select-tests)

This example uses [cypress-select-tests](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-select-tests) preprocessor plugin to filter tests, similar to how [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) has the `--grep` CLI argument. This project provides an imitation using a string (no regular expressions).

Because Cypress ignores unknown CLI parameters, you need to pass `grep` argument as an environment variables, for example by using `--env` CLI argument.

## Examples

### interactive

Open Cypress GUI but only allow running tests with `@admin` in the name

```bash
$ npm run cypress:open -- --env grep=@admin
```

shows only "@admin" tests were executed, while the rest were skipped

### headless

Run tests with `edge case` in the name in headless mode

```bash
$ npm run cypress:run -- --env grep='edge case'
```

produces

```text
Running: feature-a.js...     (1 of 2)
picking tests to run in file cypress/e2e/feature-a.js


  feature A
    - works
    - reports for @admin


  0 passing (30ms)
  2 pending

  Running: feature-b.js...   (2 of 2)
picking tests to run in file cypress/e2e/feature-b.js


  feature B
    - works
    âœ“ an edge case (54ms)
    - works for @admin


  1 passing (87ms)
  2 pending
```

## Notes

### test title

The full test title used for string matching is a concatenation of suite names plus the test's own name.

```js
describe('app', () => {
  context('feature A', () => {
    it('works', () => {
      // full test name is 'app feature A works'
    })
  })
})
```

Thus you can run all tests from the given suite

```bash
$ npm run cypress:run -- --env grep='feature A'
```

## NPM arguments

Note how you need to use `--` to separate NPM open or run script command from arguments to Cypress itself.

```bash
# runs only tests with "works" in their name
$ npm run cypress:run -- --env grep=works
```

## Quote strings with spaces

If you want to pass string with spaces, please quote it like

```bash
$ npm run cypress:run -- --env grep='feature A'
```

See the [setupNodeEvents](cypress.config.js) function for how to configure test selection preprocessor, built on top of [Cypress Browserify preprocessor](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-browserify-preprocessor).
