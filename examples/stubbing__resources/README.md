# Stubbing Resources

The spec file [cypress/integration/spec.js](cypress/integration/spec.js) shows how to stub resources that are loaded e.g. by `img` tag.

When clicking onto the button in the `index.html`, an api call is simulated that would provide an image url. This image is manipulated in order to display a predefined image.
