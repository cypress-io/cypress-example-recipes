![Current HTML as text](./images/html-text.gif)

You can get the current document's HTML using `document.documentElement.outerHTML` property. Then you can validate / sanitize the HTML. You can even write it back as text into the current browser to see it, as [spec.cy.js](./cypress/e2e/spec.cy.js) shows.
