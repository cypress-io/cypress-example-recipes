# Responsive image
> Testing how the browser loads images depending on viewport

The test in [cypress/e2e/spec.cy.js](./cypress/e2e/spec.cy.js) observes the images loaded by the `<picture>` element to confirm that the mobile version is requested for mobile viewport. The desktop viewport causes the page to request the desktop image version.

![The test](./images/picture.gif)

The loaded image resolution is confirmed using `naturalWidth` property.

```js
cy.intercept('elva-480w-close-portrait.jpg').as('mobileImage')
cy.visit('responsive-images/picture.html')
// the mobile image was loaded
cy.wait('@mobileImage')
// check the native resolution of the loaded image
cy.get('img').should('have.prop', 'naturalWidth', 480)
```
