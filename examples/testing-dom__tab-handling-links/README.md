> How to get around lack of multiple tabs in Cypress

Read [Trade-offs - Multiple tabs](http://on.cypress.io/trade-offs#Multiple-tabs), and see [cypress/e2e/tab_handling_anchor_links_spec.cy.js](cypress/e2e/tab_handling_anchor_links_spec.cy.js) how to:

- Test anchor links opening in new tabs: `<a target="_blank">`.
- Test anchor links that link to external domains: `<a href="...">`.
- Prevent content from opening in a new tab.
- Request external content that would open in a new tab using [`cy.request()`](https://on.cypress.io/request).
- Speed up tests by reducing loading times.
